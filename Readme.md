target.com allows our customers to post comment/feedback on specific products in the product details page. These comments are visible to all other customers. 

Develop a REST API to moderate/validate the comment text to prevent customers from posting objectionable content. The REST API is expected to take a piece of text as an input and respond with feedback regarding objectionable content


Deliverables:
1.	The REST API contract
2.	Working API demo
3.	Code in git
